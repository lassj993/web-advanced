			<em>Typewriter: An Instrument for writing by means of type, a typewheel, or the like, in which the operator makes use of a sort of keyboard, in order to obtain impressions of the characters upon paper.</em>
			<br>
			
			Webster's international dictionary, 1907. 
			<br>
			<br>
			In this age all poets use typewriters. Some just copy their manuscripts for the benefit of clarity, other have slightly more graphic ideas behind their thumpings. This is a collection of work from those others. 
			<br>
			<br>
			In some poetry there is rhythm, and there is rhyme, there is metrical structure within which the poet expounds his ideas, spends his words. Its hard work. In typewriter poetry there is no rhythm, and there is no rhyme, but there is a metrical structure. The space bar, the ratcheted roller, the keys themselves. within those limits the poets are more structurally minded than others - they add and adapt the basic meter. coloured ribbons, masks, different pressures, overlaps. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Gerard Manley Hopkins wasn't the only holy man to make ingenious use of meter - Sylvester isn't bad either. 
			<br>
			<br>
			It is difficult to tell quite what makes a typewriter poem (or typestract as Edwin Morgan names them) - what makes them <em>typewriter</em> poems rather than just concrete or experimental texts. (A few assorted definitions will be found in the notes at the end of this book). The consensus of opinion seems to be that the peculiarities of the typewriters' spacing itself pinpoints the difference, ie: a typestract works when done on a typewriter but fails when re-set in printers type. The letters "a", "m", "i", & "l" for example, all occupy the same space on a typewriter but all differ in printers type.
			<br>
			<br>
			The majority of works in this collection tend to be typestracts in the fullest sense, others to a slightly lesser degree. they represent the work of almost every typewriter poet of significance at present working in the u.k. from Bob Cobbing's vast duplicator overlays and dsh's olivetti masterpieces to Cavan McCarthy's simple but effective structures.
			<br>
			<br>
			Arabesques, Lawrence Pedersen calls them. But they are often more than that. Visual structures built for amplification by voice and extemporization by feet - cobbing's sonic icons, Paula Claire's performance pieces, Andrew Lloyd's sound sequences. All typewriter poems, all human but impossible without the machine.
