			From its beginnings, concrete poetry has had a special relationship with the typewriter, due to the simple fact that all typewriter characters on a given machine (certain electric models excepted) are of equal width, which opens up vast graphic possibilities. The review <em>material</em> (1957-1960) in Darmstadt, Germany was completely set on typewriters, Olivettis being the preferred make. During the 1960's, with the so called "mimeograph revolution" the possibilites were explored further in many lands, from India to Canada, the United Stated to Czechoslovakie, Sweden to Uraguay.

			Some of the most interesting work in this typewriter genre within the general medium of concrete poetry was and is being produced in the United Kingdom. And since one of the most interesting of serious magazine editors in <em>Second Aeon's</em> Peter Finch, he was in a position to make up one of the most exciting collections. The ultimate, univeral collection it is not - it makes no pretense at internationalism. But a constellation from an epicenter of the whole concrete earthquake it is. And it's in that spirit that we are proud to present it.
